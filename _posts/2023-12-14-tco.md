If you already understand tail call optimisation then this post isn't for you. If you think recursion is inherently unsafe or "bad", this post is probably for you.

What follows is a rough, high level description of what tail call optimisation is and what it's used for. Some corners were cut in definitions to keep the post small, but they should be accurate enough for our purposes.

# What is **the stack**?

**A Stack** in general is a collection of objects that you can add to and remove from in a **L**ast **I**n **F**irst **O**ut order. This means you can only take the top item off of a stack and you can only put a new item on the top of a stack.

When we refer to **The Stack** in programming, this is a stack specifically representing your programs execution. An element is added to the stack as you execute functions. An element is removed when a function completes. The individual elements are called **Stack Frames**. Let's work through a simple example.

{% highlight scala %}
def add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b

def double(a: Int) = add(a, a)

@main def simple = {
  val three = add(1, 2)
  val six = double(three)
  println(six)
}
{% endhighlight %}

If we run our program the stack will look something like this (from left to right):

<div style="overflow: auto; white-space: nowrap;">

</div>

# What is a **Stack Overflow**?

The namesake of one of our [most used sites](https://stackoverflow.com/) is an exception that you can get if your stack becomes too big for the memory allocated to your program. While technically possible to overflow the stack with just a very large, complex program, the most common way to trigger this is to use **recursion**. Recursive functions are functions that call themselves:

{% highlight scala %}
def factorial(a: BigInt): BigInt =
    if a <= 1 then 1 else a * factorial(a -1)

@main def overflow = println(factorial(10))
{% endhighlight %}

If you compile and run this program it quite happily print `3628800` which is 10 [factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial). If, however, you give larger and larger numbers rather than 10 eventually you will use all the memory allocated for the stack. On my machine right now this happens at around 30k-50k.

## Why does this happen?

Let's explore the stack again:

<img src="/assets/img/2023-12-stack/FactorialStack.png" width="100%" />

The stack keeps growing until we reach some `a` that is 1 or smaller. Everytime `factorial` calls itself we add a new stack frame that keeps track of the current value of `a` and waits for the next `factorial` to complete. When our initial `a` is small, this is fine. For much larger values of `a` the stack will eventually eat up all of the memory for our program.

This is why some developers think that recursion is "bad" or inherently unsafe. This is a very natural reaction to a program you write failing at runtime at scale.

# A manual fix

One common way to fix this is to rewrite the program to not include recursion:

{% highlight scala %}
def factorial(a: BigInt): BigInt =
    var acc = BigInt(1)
    for x <- (BigInt(1) to a) do
        acc = x * acc
    acc

@main def manualfix = println(factorial(100000))
{% endhighlight %}

This will absolutely work, however:
- We had to use mutability.
- We've lost our expressive definition of a function.
- We've had to instruct the language on _how_ to execute steps imperatively using control structures such as a for loop.

For a simple function such as `factorial` the above issue are fairly negligable. For larger recursive functions they can pose a real problem. Mutation gets gnarly very quickly when you have more than one mutation happening. Imagine we aren't just using the `for` loop but needed early returns or to combine two numbers in our for loop, following the flow of the function becomes hard.

# What is **tail call optimisation**?

Can we have our cake and eat it too? I'll first show a solution, then explain why it works.

{% highlight scala %}
def factorial(a: BigInt, acc: BigInt = 1): BigInt =
    if a <=1 then acc else factorial(a - 1, a * acc)

@main def fixed = println(factorial(100000))
{% endhighlight %}

In the above we _slightly_ changed our recursive function definition. Instead of awaiting the return of `factiorial(a - 1)` then multiplying by `a`, we accumulate our factorial result value as we are recursing through `factorial`.

This is an optimisation the Scala compiler can use to our advantage! Since we are no longer retaining any memory and the end of our function call, this allows the last frame in the stack to be re-used rather than needing to add a fresh frame.

You can even _enforce_ this by annotating a function with `@tailrec` such that the compiler will fail if your function can't be tail call optimised.

# Conclusion

Recursion is actually a fantastic tool, the definition of factorial is recursive (as are many mathematical sequences). Similarly recursing a linked list or tree fits this model very well. Hopefully I've demonstrated above that it isn't something we need to fear and using Tail Call Optimisation allows us to safely define recursion.
