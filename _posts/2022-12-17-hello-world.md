is yet another programming blog.

Hi anyone that's reading! I'm Oli. A software engineer with a passion for functional programming. I've been meaning to write up some of my ideas on programming and perhaps other topics for a long while now. I've had a draft blog for a few years, at the time of writing I have...

```bash
‚ûú  blog git:(main) ls _drafts |  wc -l
    51
```

Wow... 51. I have 51 draft blog posts I have half written. I've also partially added 7 unfinished features to this draft blog, but never felt comfortable releasing any of it into the wild as I didn't feel any of it was _perfect_. I'm hoping that creating this site and giving myself some kind of deadline will help motivate me into finishing some of these ideas off. I may append to this file and keep it as a progress/changelog.

The plan is to release one blog every 3 months, meaning the first post should go live in or before March 2023 ü§ûüèª Wish me luck.

## Changelog

### March 2023

Hooray! I managed to post my first blog post. Having a deadline really did help me actually get moving on this! I've decided that I'm going to allow myself to build one non-post feature for every two posts I write to give a little break between writing. Given this, hopefully I'll have a small feature and a new post by June ü§ûüèª.

### June 2023

It seems like 3 months is a good pace for me, I might try to keep aiming for that so theoretically the next post I write should be ready by the end of September. Now that I've finished two posts I feel like it's OK to allow myself to add in some non-writing work so I've added a simple dark mode toggle. It's one of the things I find most frustrating about many websites, even most google sites don't have a dark mode so I thought that was the best one to start with. Two posts per one non-writing feature seems like a good balance as well.

I'll also probably split this changelog into it's own page in the future since I feel like this could become a bit unwieldy if I keep this blog up for as long as I intend to.
