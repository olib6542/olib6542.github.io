# Hello World

is yet another programming blog. Hi anyone that's reading! I'm Oli. A software engineer with a passion for functional programming. I've been meaning to write up some of my ideas on programming and perhaps other topics for a long while now. I've had a draft blog for a few years, at the time of writing I have

```bash
‚ûú  blog git:(main) ls _drafts |  wc -l
    51
```

Wow... 51. I have 51 draft blog posts I have half written. I've also partially added 7 unfinished features to this draft blog, but never felt comfortable releasing any of it into the wild as I didn't feel any of it was _perfect_. I'm hoping that creating this site and giving myself some kind of deadline will help motivate me into finishing some of these ideas off. I may append to this file and keep it as a progress/changelog.

The plan is to release one blog every 3 months, meaning the first post should go live in or before March 2023 ü§ûüèª Wish me luck.
